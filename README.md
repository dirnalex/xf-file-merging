# xf-file-merging

Application for merging 2 big data files into one.</br>
The solution uses the sort-merge algorithm for joining two tables. External sorting (the 3rd party library is used) is performed for both files and then sorted files are merged into one.</br>
The example of the files could be found in the /data folder. </br>
The project is Maven-based.
